**Updated Bio:**

"**Austin Starke** — *Founder*

Built my foundation in automotive customization—car wrapping, paint protection film, and detailing. Transitioned to content marketing when I realized automotive businesses needed consistent, conversion-focused content, not just one-off productions.

Today, Starke Media serves multiple automotive businesses across Michigan with scalable content packages designed for efficiency and results. I combine hands-on automotive industry experience with data-driven marketing strategy to help shops, dealerships, and builders dominate their local markets on social media.
